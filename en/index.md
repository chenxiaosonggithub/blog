# Blog

[Click here to view my blog posts: chenxiaosong.com/blog](https://chenxiaosong.com/blog).

Most of my work involves interacting with the open-source community, so my notes are publicly available.
My notes just record the knowledge I've learned.
If they can also inspire other technology enthusiasts, that makes me even happier.

# Courses

[Click here to view the courses (continuously updated)](https://chenxiaosong.com/course.html).

I have written some tutorials in my spare time and recorded accompanying videos.
The main goal is to organize the knowledge I have learned in the past, and of course, to learn things I haven't studied yet.

# Bilibili Videos

I have uploaded some videos on Bilibili, complementing the articles on this personal homepage.
These videos document my learning progress and are also intended to inspire other technology enthusiasts.
